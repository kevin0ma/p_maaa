It's getting cold in Ithaca.

This is my favorite time of the year. I have a lab space with a couple of grad students. We turned a storage room into a pretty cozy workspace.

*Ignore the mess*

Here's what I've been working on.

<b>REDUCT</b> is a puzzle game for children about evaluating code. [Ian](http://ianarawjo.therottingcartridge.com/) is building the game, and I'm helping with narrative and design.

*It looks something like this right now*

The story centers around Starchild, an alien hopping from planet to planet in search of his home.

Planets are themed by programming concepts - the physical appearance of a planet's resident is a pseudo- representation of that concept.

Levels teach players concepts bit by bit, untimately combining them.

Starchild's ship runs on stardust, obtained by completing levels.

A very fun project to ideate on!
